1. From the pairplot, we observe that as age increases, the estimated salary also rises. This trend is associated with a higher likelihood of purchasing the given product. In reality, individuals with higher salaries are more likely to buy more products.

2. Additionally, as age increases, the estimated salary also rises, leading to a greater likelihood of individuals purchasing more products which in reality occurs too.

3. Salaries ranging from 0 to 1,00,000 tend not to result in any product purchases. However, salaries ranging from 0 to 2,00,000 are associated with uniform product purchasing.

4. From the above countplot, it appears that both males and females have the same purchasing count. Therefore, we can conclude that the dataset is well-balanced.
