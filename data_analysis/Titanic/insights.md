# **Titanic Survival Prediction**

* Women had a higher survival rate compared to men. This aligns with the historical accounts of the "women and children first" policy during the evacuation.

* Passengers in the first class had a higher survival rate compared to those in the second and third classes. This reflects the historical reality that first-class passengers had better access to lifeboats which in reality reflects too.

* Children had a higher survival rate compared to adults. This is consistent with the historical accounts that children were prioritized during the evacuation.

* Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive. This can be attributed to the fact that higher fare prices were associated with higher class tickets, which had better access to lifeboats which in real is true at all case.

* Passengers with smaller family sizes (lower numbers of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard) had higher survival rates. Large family groups may have faced more difficulty coordinating during the evacuation.

* Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C) had a higher survival rate compared to those who embarked from Southampton (S) and Queenstown (Q). This could be linked to wealthier passengers boarding at Cherbourg.

* First-class passengers were generally older compared to third-class passengers. This aligns with the socio-economic reality that older individuals could afford more expensive tickets.

* Passengers with one or two siblings/spouses (SibSp) aboard had a higher survival rate than those with none or more than two. Similarly, passengers with one or two parents/children (Parch) aboard had better survival rates, suggesting that having some family support helped but large families might have struggled, which in reality occurs too.

* From the above countplot, we can see that most people did not survive. This observation aligns with historical accounts, which state that most people perished during the Titanic shipwreck.

* There is a positive correlation between age and fare, indicating that older passengers tended to pay higher fares, likely due to them being in higher classes.
