1. Parkinson's patients tend to have lower average (MDVP(Hz)), maximum (MDVP(Hz)), and minimum (MDVP
(Hz)) vocal fundamental frequencies compared to healthy individuals this reflects the monotone and hypophonia symptoms common in Parkinson's disease.

2. Increased jitter measures (MDVP(%), MDVP(Abs), MDVP, MDVP, Jitter) indicate higher variation in pitch among Parkinson's patients.Therefore higher jitter values are associated with the tremors affecting vocal cords, leading to unstable vocal frequency, which is a characteristic symptom of Parkinson's.

3. Insight: Parkinson's patients exhibit higher shimmer measures (MDVP, MDVP(dB), Shimmer, Shimmer, MDVP, Shimmer) due to increased variation in amplitude this indicates difficulty in maintaining consistent vocal loudness, a common symptom of Parkinson's.

4. The noise-to-harmonics ratio is typically higher in Parkinson's patients this signifies a noisier and less tonal voice, which aligns with the breathiness and harshness observed in their speech.

5. Lower HNR values are common in Parkinson's patients this indicates a decrease in the tonal quality of the voice, consistent with dysarthria symptoms.

6. Nonlinear Dynamical Complexity Measures (RPDE, D2):
    These measures are higher in Parkinson's patients, indicating more complexity and irregularity in their vocal patterns reflects the neurological disruptions affecting their speech.

7. Parkinson's patients generally show higher DFA value represents a more irregular vocal signal, consistent with the loss of motor control over speech.

8. Elevated values in these measures indicate increased variability and irregularity in vocal pitch among Parkinson's patients reflects impaired motor control and difficulty in producing stable speech sounds.

9. Voice recordings provide a non-invasive, easy-to-administer screening method for Parkinson's disease
this makes it accessible for widespread use in initial diagnosis and monitoring disease progression.

10. High sensitivity of vocal measurements to detect slight changes can be crucial for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease allows for early intervention, potentially slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes.
